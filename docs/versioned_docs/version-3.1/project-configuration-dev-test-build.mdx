# Project Configuration: Dev, Test, Build

## Babel

Out of the box Redwood configures [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) so that you can write modern JavaScript and TypeScript without needing to worry about transpilation at all.
GraphQL tags, JSX, SVG imports‚Äîall of it's handled for you.

For those well-versed in Babel config, you can find Redwood's in [@redwoodjs/internal](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/tree/main/packages/internal/src/build/babel).

### Configuring Babel

For most projects, you won't need to configure Babel at all, but if you need to you can configure each side (web, api) individually using side-specific `babel.config.js` files.

> **Heads up**
>
> `.babelrc{.js}` files are ignored.
> You have to put your custom config in the appropriate side's `babel.config.js`: `web/babel.config.js` for web and `api/babel.config.js` for api.

Let's go over an example.

#### Example: Adding Emotion

Let's say we want to add the styling library [emotion](https://emotion.sh), which requires adding a Babel plugin.

1. Create a `babel.config.js` file in `web`:
```shell
touch web/babel.config.js
```
<br />

2. Add the `@emotion/babel-plugin` as a dependency:
```shell
yarn workspace web add --dev @emotion/babel-plugin
```
<br />

3. Add the plugin to `web/babel.config.js`:
```jsx title="web/babel.config.js"
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["@emotion"] // üëà add the emotion plugin
}

// ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notice how we don't need the `extends` property
```

That's it!
Now your custom web-side Babel config will be merged with Redwood's.

## Jest

Redwood uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.
Let's take a peek at how it's all configured.

At the root of your project is `jest.config.js`.
It should look like this:

```jsx title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  rootDir: '.',
  projects: ['<rootDir>/{*,!(node_modules)/**/}/jest.config.js'],
}
```

This just tells Jest that the actual config files sit in each side, allowing Jest to pick up the individual settings for each.
`rootDir` also makes sure that if you're running Jest with the `--collectCoverage` flag, it'll produce the report in the root directory.

#### Web Jest Config

The web side's configuration sits in `./web/jest.config.js`

```jsx
const config = {
  rootDir: '../',
  preset: '@redwoodjs/testing/config/jest/web',
  // ‚òùÔ∏è load the built-in Redwood Jest configuration
}

module.exports = config
```

> You can always see Redwood's latest configuration templates in the [create-redwood-app package](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/packages/create-redwood-app/template/web/jest.config.js).

The preset includes all the setup required to test everything that's going on in web: rendering React components and transforming JSX, automatically mocking Cells, transpiling with Babel, mocking the Router and the GraphQL client‚Äîthe list goes on!
You can find all the details in the [source](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/packages/testing/config/jest/web/jest-preset.js).

#### Api Side Config

The api side is configured similarly, with the configuration sitting in `./api/jest.config.js`.
But the api preset is slightly different in that:

- it's configured to run tests serially (because Scenarios seed your test database)
- it has setup code to make sure your database is 1) seeded before running tests 2) reset between Scenarios

You can find all the details in the [source](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/packages/testing/config/jest/api/jest-preset.js).

## GraphQL Codegen

You can customize the types that Redwood generates from your project too! This is documented in a bit more detail in the [Generated Types](typescript/generated-types#customising-codegen-config) doc.

## Debugger configuration
The `yarn rw dev` command is configured by default to launch a debugger on the port `18911`, your Redwood app also ships with default configuration to attach a debugger from VSCode.

Simply run your dev server, then attach the debugger from the "run and debug" panel. Quick demo below:

<ReactPlayer width='100%' height='100%' controls url='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1521877/159887978-95075ccd-d10c-403c-90cc-a5b944c429e3.mp4' />


<br/>

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Tip: Can't see the "Attach debugger" configuration?** In VSCode
>
> You can grab the latest launch.json from the Redwood template [here](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/packages/create-redwood-app/template/.vscode/launch.json). Copy the contents into your project's `.vscode/launch.json`


#### Customizing the debug port
You can choose to use a different debug port in one of two ways:

**a) Using the redwood.toml**

Add/change the `debugPort` under your api settings

```toml title="redwood.toml"
[web]
  # .
  # .
[api]
  port = 8911
  // highlight-next-line
  debugPort = 18911 # üëà change me!
```

If you set it to `false`, no debug port will be exposed. The `debugPort` is only ever used during development when running `yarn rw dev`

**b) Pass a flag to `rw dev` command**

You can also pass a flag when you launch your dev servers, for example:

```bash
yarn rw dev --debugPort 75028
```
The flag passed in the CLI will always take precedence over your setting in the `redwood.toml`

Just remember to also change the port you are attaching to in your `./vscode/launch.json`

## Ignoring the `.yarn` folder

The `.yarn` folder contains the most recent Yarn executable that Redwood supports
which is the [recommended way](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/7741)
to ensure things run smoothly for everyone. From VSCode's perspective, this of course
is just another folder containing code, so it will

1. include its contents in project-wide, full-text searches
2. display it in the file browser
3. watch its contents for changes

‚Ä¶ which, depending on your personal preference, is something you may not need or want.

Fortunately, all these aspects are configurable via VSCode's `settings.json`. You have the
choice of making these changes to your local Redwood project's configuration
found in `.vscode/settings.json` or globally (so they apply to other projects as
well). For global changes, hit <kbd>F1</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>
(that's <kbd>‚åò</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> if you're on Mac)
and search for "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)".

Note that the local workspace configuration always overrules your user settings.
The VSCode website [provides an extensive explanation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-precedence)
on how its config inheritance works. It also has a complete reference of
[all available settings and their defaults](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_default-settings).

### Excluding a folder from search results only

Adding the following would exclude any `.yarn` folder encountered anywhere in
the project (that's what the
`**` [glob pattern](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_advanced-search-options)
does) from search results:

```json
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/.yarn": true
  }
```

### Excluding a folder from the file browser and searching

```json
  "files.exclude": {
    "**/.yarn": true
  }
```

This setting also excludes all matching folders and files from search results,
so there's no point in adding a `search.exclude` setting separately.

Don't worry: this setting won't influence change detection in your "Source Control"
tab‚Äîthat would be managed via `.gitignore`.

### Excluding a folder from watching

```json
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/.yarn": true
  }
```

This setting works independently of the ones above and so it needs to be added
separately. It's important to note that files or folders matched by this
setting will no longer immediately appear (or disappear):
- from existing search results (but as soon as you search again or change the search term, they'll be discovered)
- in your "Source Control" tab, unless you hit the "Refresh" button

Admittedly, the `.yarn` folder won't change that often, so this may not be
the best example. But we thought we'd share this technique with you
so that you'd know how to apply it to any folders that you know change very often,
and how to tell VSCode not to bother wasting any CPU cycles on them.
